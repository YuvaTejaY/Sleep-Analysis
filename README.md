The Sleep Disorder Detection App is a Python-based application built using Tkinter, designed to help users assess potential sleep disorders by analyzing their sleep-related data. It provides a user-friendly interface where individuals can enter details such as age, bedtime, wake-up time, and total sleep duration to evaluate their sleep quality. Additionally, users answer Yes/No questions related to common sleep disorder symptoms like snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, and restlessness. Based on the inputs, the app identifies possible sleep disorders such as insomnia, sleep apnea, hypersomnia, and restless leg syndrome (RLS). The application features an intuitive GUI with a background image, well-organized input fields, and interactive buttons for easy navigation. It includes a Submit button to process data and display results, along with a Refresh button to reset the form for new entries. The app also enhances user engagement by displaying the current date and time at the top of the window, along with a motivational sleep-related quote.
